fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}


// main always is the first code that runs in every executable rust program. 
// a rust macro is way to write code that generates code to extend Rust syntax https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html
// ! means your calling a macro not a normal function and macros don't always follow the same rules as functions.
